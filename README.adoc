The goal is having https://www.home-assistant.io/[Home Assistant] deployed on a https://www.raspberrypi.com/[RaspberryPI].

The SD card image build process needs to be repeatable, hence the use of a https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes[Nix flake] to provide a https://docs.yoctoproject.org/[Yocto development environment] in charge of producing the said image.
Currently, the idea is to rely on:

* The https://github.com/nix-community/nix-environments/tree/master/envs/yocto[Yocto environment] provided by the https://github.com/nix-community/nix-environments[community Nix environments].
* This https://github.com/meta-homeassistant/meta-homeassistant[meta-homeassistant] Yocto layer maintained on Github.
